<h1 align = "center"> Graph Network </h1>

The objective of this project is the implementation of complex algorithms specific to graphs as well as the construction of methods for displaying them.

## Getting Started

Prerequisites
* A computer running Windows, macOS, or Linux
* Visual Studio (for C++ development), Visual Studio Code
* Python (with some additional libraries) 
* Microsoft Excel

## Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine using git clone (or download the zip file and extract it).
```shell
git clone https://github.com/samuelburaga/graph-network.git
```
2. The Coding folder contains some .cpp and .h files wich implement some algorithms used to solve graph specific problems and also export the adjacency matrix, adjacency list and incidence matrix in csv format. You can run it by creating a new Visual Studio project and use my files to create the identical structure and then run the Source.cpp file.
3. To visualize the graph you need to install the following libraries for Python first: NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, NetworkX and then you simply open the "Graph Network" subfolder from App directory with visual studio code and run the code. Note that this alos exports the adjacency matrix, adjacency list and incidence matrix in csv format.
